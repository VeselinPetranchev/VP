# FIRE STICKS

On a piece of paper divided into squares are placed matches, such as a connected figure. Two types of sticks are used - those with a length of
1 are placed on the side of the squares, and those with a length of sqrt(2) - on the diagonals. The figure of the matches must be "lit", as the ignition
point must have integer coordinates (in Point A can't, while B and C can / look image.png file/ ). The fire is spreading evenly each stick has its own speed. The sticks can burn in several places (if they are on fire at both ends or when diagonal a match caught fire at its intersection - the fire spreads in both directions evenly). Write a program which finds the point where it should be lit figure to burn in minimum time.

In the input file are saved: in the beginning N - the number of sticks; then there are 5 numbers-X1, Y1, X2, X2, T, which represent the coordinates of the two ends of the match and the time of burning (provided it is lit from one end). There can be no overlap of sticks. As a result, they must be the coordinates of the ignition point, as well as the time ofburn the whole connected figure.
